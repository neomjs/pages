# Feature: Expose GitHub Meritocracy Index in Portal App Examples

### Problem
With the `devindex` flagship application ready for public release, it needs to be prominently featured and accessible directly from the Neo.mjs Portal App's component/example browser so users can immediately experience the "killer demo" for 50k record rendering.

### Solution
Added the "GitHub Meritocracy Index" to all four example environment JSON definitions:
- `apps/portal/resources/data/examples_devmode.json`
- `apps/portal/resources/data/examples_dist_dev.json`
- `apps/portal/resources/data/examples_dist_esm.json`
- `apps/portal/resources/data/examples_dist_prod.json`

The entry uses the newly uploaded `devmode/DevIndex.png` preview image and links directly to the `apps/devindex` workspace.
