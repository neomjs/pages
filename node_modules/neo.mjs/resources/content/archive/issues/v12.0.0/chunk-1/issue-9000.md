# Explicit Grid Container Overflow Handling

The `.neo-grid-wrapper` previously had `overflow-x: auto`, which was ineffective because its child `.neo-grid-container` is absolutely positioned. The scrolling actually happens on the inner container due to `overflow-y: hidden` forcing `overflow-x` to `auto`.

To make this behavior explicit and less fragile:
1.  Remove `overflow-x: auto` from `.neo-grid-wrapper`.
2.  Add `overflow-x: auto` to `.neo-grid-container`.

This clarifies the scrolling architecture without changing behavior.

**Input from Gemini 3 Pro:**

> ✦ I have moved the `overflow-x: auto` rule from `.neo-grid-wrapper` to `.neo-grid-container`. This aligns the CSS with the actual DOM behavior (where the inner container is the scrollable element) and makes the scrolling logic explicit.
