simulation uses a **Reference Viewport Strategy**.\n- **Baseline:** 1920x1080 is defined as scale `1.0`.\n- **Dynamic Scaling:** On resize, a `scale` factor is calculated: `sqrt((width * height) /

**Density Control:** On small screens (`scale < 0.5`), the background layer is culled to prevent visual noise.\n\n**Theme System:**\nSupports dynamic `light` and `dark` modes via the `theme` config.\n- **Palette:** A static `colors` map defines semantic color slots (agentHead, spark, etc.) for each mode.\n- **Hot-Swapping:** Changing the `theme` config triggers `updateResources` to regenerate gradients and\n  immediately alters rendering colors in the next frame without re-initializing buffers.\n\n**Performance Architecture (Zero-Allocation):**\nTo maintain 60fps on high-refresh
